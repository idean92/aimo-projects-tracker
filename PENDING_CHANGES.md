# Pending Changes — AIMO Tracker

Tracks requested changes from consolidation through approval to shipped, per the
process in `CLAUDE.md`. Newest items at the top of each section.

## Summary
| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| P2 | Purple design-system reskin (matching Safety Tracker) | Built + reviewed (v1.2), not deployed |
| P1 | In-app feedback button + Cloudflare/Notion endpoint | ✅ Shipped and fully working (v1.1) |

## 🐛 Bugs
_(none yet)_

## ✨ Improvements
- **P2 (follow-up, optional)** — ~20-30 hardcoded RAG-status/comment-class/gantt
  color literals still use the pre-reskin saturated green/amber/red rather than the
  new muted semantic set. Deliberately left out of P2's scope; low visual impact.

## 🆕 New
_(none currently in progress)_

## ✅ Shipped
- **P2 — Purple design-system reskin** (v1.2, 01 Aug 2026, owner-supplied design
  doc, built directly on explicit request). Full palette/gradient/shape/shadow
  overhaul matching the Safety Tracker sibling's look — see `CHANGELOG.md` for
  detail. Independently reviewed before finalizing; two real bugs found and fixed
  (`.btn-primary` hover color, `.card-visual` corner clipping). Built and QA'd;
  **not shipped** (`public/index.html` untouched) pending explicit "ship it".
- **P1 — In-app feedback button + endpoint** (v1.1, 01 Aug 2026). Floating button +
  modal in `aimo-tracker.html`, Cloudflare Worker endpoint (`src/worker.js`) filing
  into the Notion Feedback Inbox. Live at
  https://aimo-projects-tracker.ideandaai.workers.dev with `NOTION_API_KEY` /
  `NOTION_FEEDBACK_DATABASE_ID` configured — end-to-end tested (submitted via direct
  API call, confirmed the row landed in Feedback Inbox with correct fields). Fully
  working. Remaining loose end (infra, not this feature): Cloudflare is tracking the
  `claude/review-pending-context-jbjnrg` branch as production, not `main` (no `main`
  branch exists yet in this repo) — revisit once/if this branch is merged.
