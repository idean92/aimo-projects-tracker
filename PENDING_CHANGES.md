## 🐛 Bugs
_(none yet)_

## ✨ Improvements
- **P2 (follow-up, optional)** — ~20-30 hardcoded RAG-status/comment-class/gantt
  color literals still use the pre-reskin saturated green/amber/red rather than the
  new muted semantic set. Deliberately left out of P2's scope; low visual impact.

## ✅ Shipped
- **P6 — Consolidated Supabase into AIMO-SMS-Tracker** (01 Aug 2026). After P4 (D1
  trial) hit a real blocker — Cloudflare Access can't path-scope protection on a
  bare `workers.dev` domain, only whole-Worker — and given the same real people use
  both AIMO Tracker and Safety Tracker anyway, went back to the original
  consolidation option instead. Created schema `projects` in `AIMO-SMS-Tracker`
  (ref `kvbmgyupyzegtgbnqktk`) with a `team_state` table matching the standalone
  project's shape + RLS policy; verified `public.app_state`/`public.team_state`
  (the Safety Tracker's own tables, live data) untouched — row counts confirmed
  unchanged before/after. Removed all D1-trial code from the repo (`src/access.js`,
  `migrations/`, `scripts/test-access-jwt.mjs`, the two Worker routes, the D1
  binding) and deleted the (empty) trial D1 database. Paused the now-unused
  standalone `AIMO-Projects-Tracker` Supabase project (reversible, not deleted) —
  this frees a real project slot; `wealth-tracker` could be unpaused separately if
  wanted. See `docs/SUPABASE.md` for full detail and the one remaining manual step
  (exposing the `projects` schema in API settings — dashboard-only, needed before
  any future client code can query it). `docs/D1-TRIAL.md` kept, marked abandoned,
  for the Access/workers.dev gotcha it surfaced.
- **P4 — D1 + Cloudflare Access trial.** ❌ Abandoned in favor of P6 — see above and
  `docs/D1-TRIAL.md`.
- **P5 — First real user feedback, addressed** (v1.4, 01 Aug 2026). Source: two
  submissions via the in-app feedback button (Notion Feedback Inbox). (1) Project
  cards: removed crosshair corner brackets, replaced with a frosted-glass card
  (translucent + backdrop blur, "iPhone glass" look as requested). (2) Safety tab:
  removed the embedded MOC/Risk Verification/Observations sub-tabs (stale
  duplicate of the dedicated Safety Tracker app's functionality) and replaced
  with a redirect card linking to https://aimo-safety-tracker.ideandaai.workers.dev.
  See `CHANGELOG.md` for detail. Built, QA'd, and shipped to `public/index.html`
  on the owner's explicit "ship it" — pushed to
  https://aimo-projects-tracker.ideandaai.workers.dev. Both Notion feedback rows
  marked Status: Planned.
- **P3 — Reskin refinement pass** (v1.3, 01 Aug 2026, built directly from owner
  screenshots of the live Safety Tracker sibling). Accent bars on section headers,
  colored top borders on stat/KPI tiles, amber/orange active-nav-tab indicator, and
  a fix for the header's "Session" button (was unreadable — light-mode ghost style
  on the new dark header). See `CHANGELOG.md` for detail. Built, QA'd, and shipped
  to `public/index.html` on the owner's explicit "deploy this too" — pushed to
  https://aimo-projects-tracker.ideandaai.workers.dev.
- **P2 — Purple design-system reskin** (v1.2, 01 Aug 2026, owner-supplied design
  doc, built directly on explicit request). Full palette/gradient/shape/shadow
  overhaul matching the Safety Tracker sibling's look — see `CHANGELOG.md` for
  detail. Independently reviewed before finalizing; two real bugs found and fixed
  (`.btn-primary` hover color, `.card-visual` corner clipping). Built, QA'd, and
  shipped to `public/index.html` on the owner's explicit "deploy it" — pushed to
  https://aimo-projects-tracker.ideandaai.workers.dev.
- **P1 — In-app feedback button + endpoint** (v1.1, 01 Aug 2026). Floating button +
  modal in `aimo-tracker.html`, Cloudflare Worker endpoint (`src/worker.js`) filing
  into the Notion Feedback Inbox. Live at
  https://aimo-projects-tracker.ideandaai.workers.dev with `NOTION_API_KEY` /
  `NOTION_FEEDBACK_DATABASE_ID` configured — end-to-end tested (submitted via direct
  API call, confirmed the row landed in Feedback Inbox with correct fields). Fully
  working. Remaining loose end (infra, not this feature): Cloudflare is tracking the
  `claude/review-pending-context-jbjnrg` branch as production, not `main` (no `main`
  branch exists yet in this repo) — revisit once/if this branch is merged.
